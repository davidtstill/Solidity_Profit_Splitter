# Solidity_Profit_Splitter

The premise of this assignment is that we are a startup that has created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to help connect financial institutions. The company wants to build smart contracts to automate some of its company finances and increase transparency. 

This Solidity contract allows the company to pay its Associate-level employees quickily and easily. A key assumption is that all Associate employees make the same amount of money.
