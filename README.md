# Solidity_Profit_Splitter

This is a smart contract that was built using the Remix IDE.  

The smart contract was built to allow a company to pay employees quickily and easily. The company created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain to accomplish this taks. 

In the first smart contract 'Associate_Profit_Splitter', the company wants an easy way to pay all its Associate-level employees. A key assumption is that all the Associate-level employees make the same amount of money. 

In the 'Tiered_Profit_Splitter' file, the comapany wants an easy way to pay different tiers of its employees (CEO, CTO and Bob). Points are used to represent the percentage of crypto that is allocated to each of them.

The purpose of creating this smart contract is not only able to better to more quickly and easily pay employees, but it also now has increased transparency by making this information public on the blockchain.
