# Solidity_Profit_Splitter

This is a smart contract that was built using the Remix IDE.  

The smart contract was built to allow a fictious company to pay its Associate-level employees quickily and easily. The company created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain. 

In the 'Solidity_Profit_Splitter' file, a key assumption is that all Associate employees make the same amount of money. 

The purpose of creating this smart contract is not only able to better to more quickly and easily pay its Associate-level employees, but it also now has increased transparency by making this information public on the blockchain.
