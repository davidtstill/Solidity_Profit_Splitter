# Solidity_Profit_Splitter

This is a smart contract that was built using the Remix IDE. 

The smart contract was built to allow a fictious company to pay its Associate-level employees quickily and easily. A key assumption is that all Associate employees make the same amount of money. In order to accomplish this, the company created its own Ethereum-compatible blockchain.

By creating this smart contract, the company is not only able to better to more quickly and easily pay its Associate-level employees, but it also now has increased transparency as everything will be public on the blockchain.
